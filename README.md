# Install Manually

Option 1 - files above document root:

* place the contents of public into your public folder (.htaccess and index.php)
* navigate to your project in terminal and type composer install to initiate the composer install.
* edit public/.htaccess set the rewritebase if running on a sub folder otherwise a single / will do.
* edit app/Config.example.php change the SITEURL and DIR constants. the DIR path this is relative to the project url for example / for on the root or /foldername/ when in a folder. Also change other options as desired. Rename file as Config.php
* Import the database.sql to your database (Updated table PREFIX if changed in Config.php).
* Enjoy!

Option 2 - everything inside your public folder

* place all files inside your public folder
* navigate to the public folder in terminal and type composer install to initiate the composer install.
* open index.php and change the paths from using DIR to FILE:

````
define('APPDIR', realpath(__DIR__.'/app/').'/');
define('SYSTEMDIR', realpath(__DIR__.'/system/').'/');
define('PUBLICDIR', realpath(__DIR__).'/');
define('ROOTDIR', realpath(__DIR__).'/');
````

* edit .htaccess set the rewritebase if running on a sub folder otherwise a single / will do.
* edit system/Core/Config.example.php change the SITEURL and DIR constants. the DIR path this is relative to the project url for example / for on the root or /foldername/ when in a folder. Also change other options as desired. Rename file as Config.php
* Import the database.sql to your database (Updated table PREFIX if changed in Config.php).
* Enjoy!

##Setting up a VirtualHost (Optional but recommended)

Navigate to:
````
<path to your xampp installation>\apache\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf
````

and uncomment:

````
NameVirtualHost *:80
````

Then add your VirtualHost to the same file at the bottom:

````
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    DocumentRoot "C:\xampp\htdocs\testproject\public"
    ServerName testproject.dev

    <Directory "C:\xampp\htdocs\testproject\public">
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
````

Finally, find your hosts file and add:

````
127.0.0.1       testproject.dev
````

You should then have a virtual host set up, and in your web browser, you can navigate to testproject.dev to see what you are working on.
