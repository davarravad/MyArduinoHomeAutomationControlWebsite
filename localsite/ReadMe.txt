The contents in this folder (localsite) need to only be readable by the
arduino.  Due to the fact that Arduino Microcontrollers can not use
https you have to take other security measures to prevent intruders.

Note:  Do not let files in localsite folder be public.  The files must be
private.  Noone wants someone else playing with their lights while they are
